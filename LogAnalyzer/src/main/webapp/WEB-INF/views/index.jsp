		<h1>Log Analyzer</h1>
		<p>
			This tool will help you to analyze the different kind of logs easily.
			<br> Currently we have provided functionality to minify the odl
			logs file by removing unnecessary log lines/details, and can view all
			the errors reported, in UI itself. <br> Pl/Sql analyzer is
			designed by considering logging of element related packages. Where
			entering and leaving statements are printed. This analyzer will
			provide all the procedures for which we have entering logs but,
			either we do not have leaving logs or we do not have leaving logs
			because of unhandled exception.
		</p>
		<p>You can use the same from nav-bar. Other features will be
			delivered soon</p>
