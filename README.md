Log Analyzer
This tool will help you to analyze the different kind of logs easily.
Currently we have provided functionality to minify the odl logs file by removing unnecessary log lines/details, and can view all the errors reported, in UI itself.
Pl/Sql analyzer is designed by considering logging of element related packages. Where entering and leaving statements are printed. This analyzer will provide all the procedures for which we have entering logs but, either we do not have leaving logs or we do not have leaving logs because of unhandled exception.

You can use the same from nav-bar. Other features will be delivered soon
